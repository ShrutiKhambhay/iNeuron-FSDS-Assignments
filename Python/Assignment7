Q.1.	Create two int type variables, apply addition, subtraction, division and multiplications and store the results in variables. Then print the data in the following format by calling the variables:
First variable is		& second variable is     .
Addition: __ + __ = __  	
Subtraction:	__	-	__ = __
Multiplication:	__ *	__	=	__
Division: __	/	__ = 	__
A.1. Code:
	a=20
	b=3
	add = a+b
	sub = a-b
	div = a/b
	mul = a*b
	print(”First variable is",a,"& second variable is",b)
	print("Addition:",a,"+",b,"=",add)
	print("Subtraction:",a,"-",b,"=",sub)
	print("Division:",a,"/",b,"=",div)
	print("Multiplication:",a,"*",b,"=",mul)

Q.2.	What is the difference between the following operators:
(i)	‘/’ & ‘//’
(ii)	‘**’ & ‘^’
A.2. (i) ‘/’ and ‘//’ both are Arithmetic Operators. 
	‘/’ is Division Operator. It performs division operation between two operands.
	For eg. a=20
	             b=3
		   print( a / b )
	      o/p: 6.66666667
	‘/’ is Floor Division Operator. It performs floor division operation between two operands (eliminates the fractional value).
	For eg. a=20
	             b=3
		   print( a // b )
	      o/p: 6

Q.3.	List the logical operators.
  A.3.   i) and operator 
	  ii) or operator
	  iii) not operator

Q.4.	Explain right shift operator and left shift operator with examples.
A.4.  Right shift operator moves the bit values of a binary object to the right for given number of times.
For eg, a=9>>2  
  9=> 1001
  Moving bits to the right 2 times gives 0010
  So a= 9>>2 = 2
Left shift operator moves the bit values of a binary object to the left for given number of times.
For eg, a=9<<2  
  9 => 1001
  Moving bits to the left 2 times gives 100100
  So a= 9<<2 = 36

Q.5.	Create a list containing int type data of length 15. Then write a code to check if 10 is present in the list or not.
A.5. Code:
List1 = [ 1, 5, 12, 7 ,10, 9, 11, 12, 3, 2, 8, 9, 4, 0, 11 ]
if 10 in List1:
	print(“10 is present in list”)
else:	
	print(“10 is not present in list”)
