1.What are the two values of the Boolean data type? How do you write them?
A.1 True and False are two values of the boolen data types. They are keywords.
For eg. a=True
        print(not a)
    o/p False

2. What are the three different types of Boolean operators?
A.2 The three differnt types of Boolean operators in python are: or and not
    For eg.  a=1
             b=0
             print(a and b)
             print(a or b)
             print(not b)
        o/p 0
            1
            1

3. Make a list of each Boolean operator&#39;s truth tables (i.e. every possible combination of Boolean
values for the operator and what it evaluate ).
A.3 i) and Operator:
        True and True is True
        True and False is False
        False and True is False
        False and False is False
    ii) or operator:
        True and True is True
        True and False is True
        False and True is True
        False and False is False
    iii) not Operator:
        True not is False
        False not is True

4. What are the values of the following expressions?
(5 > 4) and (3 == 5)
not (5 > 4)
(5 > 4) or (3 == 5)
not ((5 > 4) or (3 == 5))
(True and True) and (True == False)
(not False) or (not True)
A.4 (5 > 4) and (3 == 5)
    False
    not (5 > 4)
    False
    (5 > 4) or (3 == 5)
    True
    not ((5 > 4) or (3 == 5))
    False
    (True and True) and (True == False)
    False
    (not False) or (not True)
    True

5. What are the six comparison operators?
A.5 The Six comparision operators are == , != , < , > , <= , =>

6. How do you tell the difference between the equal to and assignment operators?Describe a
condition and when you would use one.
A.6 == is the equal to operator that compares two values and evaluates to a Boolean, while = is that assignment operator that stores a value in a variable.
    For eg. a = 10
            if a == 10:
                print(Equals)
            print(a)
        o/p Equals
            10

7. Identify the three blocks in this code:
spam = 0
if spam == 10:
print('eggs')
if spam > 5:
print('bacon')
else:
print('ham')
print('spam')
print('spam')
A.7 spam = 0
    if spam == 10:
        print('eggs')     => Block1
    if spam > 5:
        print('bacon')    => Block2
    else:
        print('ham')
        print('spam')     => Block3
        print('spam')       

8. Write code that prints Hello if 1 is stored in spam, prints Howdy if 2 is stored in spam, and prints
Greetings! if anything else is stored in spam.
A.8 Code:
    def spamCode(spam):
        if spam==1:
            print('Hello')
        elif spam==2:
            print('Howdy')
        else:
            print('Greetings')
    spamCode(1) 
    spamCode(2)
    spamCode(3)

9.If your programme is stuck in an endless loop, what keys youâ€™ll press?
A.9 Press Ctrl+C to stop a program stuck in an infinite loop

10. How can you tell the difference between break and continue?
A.10 The break statement will move the execution outside the loop if break condtion is satisfied. Whereas the continue statement will move the execution to the start of the loop.

11. In a for loop, what is the difference between range(10), range(0, 10), and range(0, 10, 1)?
A.11 range(10) - range from 0 to 9 (but not include 10)
     range (0,10) - indicates to start from 0 to 9
     range(0,10,1) - indicates to increase the variable by 1 on each iteration

12. Write a short program that prints the numbers 1 to 10 using a for loop. Then write an equivalent
program that prints the numbers 1 to 10 using a while loop.
A.12 Code:
        #Using Foro loop
        for i in range(1,11):
            print(i, end=" ")
        #Using While loop
        i=1
        while i<=10:
            print(i, end=" ")
            i+=1

13. If you had a function named bacon() inside a module named spam, how would you call it after
importing spam?
A.13 spam.bacon()
